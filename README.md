## Steps to run the same project on CoLab

# 1. Download the notebook
# 2. Upload the notebook in colaboratory
# 3. Upload the required data for your project into a folder in the colaboratory
# It is better if you create a folder and store all the data,i.e, more than one pdf inside that folder.
# 4. Run all the code blocks
# If you encounter any error it is only because the libraries that are used in the code might have been updated by the time you are running it.So,try to reslove those errors.
